# General MIDI SF2 Bank Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the General MIDI SoundFont bank.

In a real implementation, this would be a binary .sf2 file containing:
- 128 General MIDI instrument sounds
- 1 drum kit
- Standard GM mapping
- 16-bit sample resolution
- Various sample rates

File specifications:
- Format: SoundFont 2.0 (.sf2)
- Size: ~2.5 MB
- Instruments: 128 GM instruments + 1 drum kit
- Sample rate: 44.1 kHz
- Bit depth: 16-bit

This file should be replaced with an actual General MIDI SoundFont bank.
